--Analyze data regardless of events. This will be needed for anatomical measures.

Added AliceSleepwareG3 option which uses .rml for sleep and events. 

bugfix: Analyze.m is altered so that windows containing unknown sleep stages are not analyzed (stage = -1).

Ratings fixes: 
1.) 3rd and 4th numeric col in AnalyzeDataSpreadsheet.xlsx were unlabelled. 3rd col now reflects whether user would like to rate data.
2.) undo function left a value of 0.9 in the rated window.

20140912

bugfix: ConvertToMat line 8 changed from "fname=[Filenames{1}(1:end-4) '.mat'];" to "fname=[Filenames{n}(1:end-4) '.mat'];"

Output filenames changed to "<...>_XHz"

line 348 of ConvertToMat changed to exist(char(temp(n)),'var') from exist(char(temp(n))) since ECG is a function as well as a candidate variable.


20140815

ConvertToMat can now handle data from Spike.

Mixed events are converted (optionally) as a separate channel, rather than lumping these with obstructive apneas. The option to do this is set in ConvertDataSPreadsheet

Analysis.m now exports the longestWake duration for each epoch (for later inclusion/exclusion as per the user).

Longest wake to include is default 30 sec and set in AnalyzeDataSpreadsheet.

Ratings is new functionality that opens each figure and allows you to rate each epoch. Ratings are stored in the appropriate Report. Ratings requires that figures were exported.

The Report now shows longestWake and ratings information
